# ðŸŒ± Plant Disease Classification

This repository contains a web-based application built with **Streamlit** to classify plant diseases. The app uses a pre-trained **TensorFlow** model to predict the health status of plants based on uploaded images.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Upload Images**: Supports `jpg`, `jpeg`, and `png` image formats.
- **Accurate Predictions**: Classifies plant health into one of the following categories:
  - `Early_Blight`
  - `Late_Blight`
  - `Healthy`
- **Confidence Score**: Displays the model's confidence in its predictions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive UI with attractive design elements.
